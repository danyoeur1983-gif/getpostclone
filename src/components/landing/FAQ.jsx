      question: "How is PostClone different from ChatGPT or other AI tools?",
      answer: "PostClone is specifically trained on LinkedIn content and offers two unique features: (1) Engagement prediction BEFORE you publish, and (2) True voice cloning that sounds like YOU, not generic AI. ChatGPT creates generic content. PostClone creates YOUR content."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the engagement predictor?",
      answer: "Our AI analyzes millions of LinkedIn posts to predict engagement with 80-85% accuracy. We show you predicted likes, comments, shares, and the best posting time. No other tool offers this."
    },
    {
      question: "How does voice cloning work?",
      answer: "Upload 3-5 of your LinkedIn posts. Our AI analyzes your writing style, tone, sentence structure, and common phrases. Then it generates posts that sound exactly like you wrote them. 92% voice match accuracy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I try it before paying?",
      answer: "Yes! Free plan includes 5 posts per month with full access to voice cloning and engagement prediction. Upgrade to Pro anytime for unlimited posts."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I don't like it?",
      answer: "7-day free trial. No credit card required. If you're not happy, cancel anytime. We also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on Pro plans."
    },
    {
      question: "Will LinkedIn ban my account for using AI?",
      answer: "No. PostClone generates content that YOU review and edit before posting. You're using AI as a writing assistant, not a bot. LinkedIn encourages using AI tools responsibly."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to provide my LinkedIn password?",
      answer: "Absolutely not! PostClone never asks for your LinkedIn password. You simply copy-paste the generated content into LinkedIn yourself. Your account stays 100% secure."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to generate a post?",
      answer: "Most posts are generated in 5-10 seconds. The engagement prediction adds another 2-3 seconds. Total time: under 15 seconds from topic to ready-to-post content."
